# VirtualTourist
VirtualTourist lets you travel the world via Flickr images.  Put a pin on the map and see what pictures were taken from that location.

## Usage
- To put a pin on the map, zoom in to the desired location and then tap and hold
- When a pin is tapped, the collection view will show up to 15 random images from Flickr that were taken at that particular GPS location
- To get new random images, click on the "New Collection" button at the bottom of the collection view
- To delete a particular image, tap it and the images will adjust the display automatically
- All pins and images will persist until manually changed
